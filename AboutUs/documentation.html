                                  around different ideas on what kind of website we should make. Everyone had something to share, and even though we were a bit unsure at first, it was fun seeing 
                                  how our thoughts slowly came together. Some of us were writing things down, others were checking references on our phones, and a few were just throwing out ideas.

                                  We listed down all the important points we wanted to cover, from famous inventors to big breakthroughs in transportation and communication. It was a bit overwhelming at first, 
                                  but seeing it organized like this helped everything feel more doable. Each of us picked sections we were most interested in, and just like that, we turned a huge task into 
                                  something we could tackle together. It felt like we were finally getting somewhere.</p>

                                  A couple of us were screen sharing so everyone could chime in with ideas or help fix things on the spot. We were bouncing ideas off each other, tweaking the design, and 
                                  seeing the site slowly come together.</p>

                                  completed code through Discord so the rest of the team could review or integrate it into the main project. This helped us stay organized and made it easy to track progress. 
                                  By sharing our updates in real time, we ensured that everyone stayed on the same page and that all the pieces of the website came together smoothly.</p>

                                  while working on their assigned parts, just like before. We shared updates, gave each other quick feedback, and helped troubleshoot bugs as they came up. 
                                  Even though we had our own individual tasks, being on call made it feel like we were coding side by side, it kept things efficient and collaborative.</p>

                                  other and going through the last few things that needed to get done. It wasn’t just about finishing tasks, We really wanted to make sure nothing was missed. 
                                  People gave quick updates, asked questions, and helped out where needed. By the end of the call, we were all on the same page and felt good about where things stood. 
                                  It was a chill but super productive way to wrap everything up together.</p>
