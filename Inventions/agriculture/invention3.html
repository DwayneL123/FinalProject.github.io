          <p class="section-text">Crop rotation is an agricultural method that involves growing different types of crops in the same area across different seasons or years. Rather than planting the same crop repeatedly in a field, farmers rotate crops in a specific sequence to help maintain the health and fertility of the soil. This method also aids in controlling pests, diseases, and weeds by interrupting their life cycles. The main purpose of crop rotation is to improve soil health and agricultural sustainability. Different crops have varying nutrient needs and contribute differently to soil structure and organic matter. For example, planting nitrogen-fixing legumes one year followed by a cereal crop the next can naturally replenish soil nutrients and reduce the need for chemical fertilizers. Crop rotation also helps to break the cycles of pests and diseases that often thrive when a single crop is grown continuously, thereby reducing reliance on pesticides.</p>

          <p class="section-text">Crop rotation is implemented through careful planning of crop sequences that complement each other both in nutrient usage and pest resistance. A common rotation pattern may begin with nutrient-demanding crops such as corn or potatoes, followed by grains like wheat or oats, and then a rest period with legumes or cover crops such as clover, which enrich the soil with nitrogen. The key to an effective rotation system is diversity alternating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted crops, and mixing plants that consume different nutrients from the soil. This planned diversity promotes long-term productivity and ecological balance. The practice of crop rotation dates back to ancient agriculture. Early farmers in the Near East were using forms of crop rotation as far back as 6000 BCE. In medieval Europe, the two-field and later the three-field systems allowed one section of land to rest each year to recover fertility. A significant advancement came in the 18th century with the development of the Norfolk four-course system in England. This method eliminated the need for fallow land by rotating wheat, turnips, barley, and clover, leading to higher yields and better soil maintenance.</p>

          <p class="section-text">While crop rotation has been used by many cultures throughout history, the Norfolk four-course system is particularly associated with Charles Townshend, an 18th-century British landowner and politician. He promoted this rotation method during the Agricultural Revolution in Britain, demonstrating its benefits in improving soil fertility and boosting productivity. His efforts helped popularize crop rotation as a key innovation in modern farming. Crop rotation has had a lasting impact on agriculture and society. It contributes to sustainable farming by maintaining healthy soil, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and increasing overall crop productivity. This practice supports environmental conservation by reducing erosion and promoting biodiversity. Economically, it helps farmers achieve more reliable harvests and reduces input costs. As a cornerstone of sustainable agriculture, crop rotation continues to play a critical role in food security and environmental stewardship.</p>
