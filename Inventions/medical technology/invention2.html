          <h2 class="section-title">Short Description</h2>
          <p class="section-text">Antibiotics are medications to stop bacteria from multiplying and can make it kill them. These powerful substances are designed specifically to fight bacterial infections inside the human body. They do not work against viruses but are extremely effective when it comes to treating illnesses caused by bacteria.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-item">
          <h2 class="section-title">Purpose</h2>
          <p class="section-text">It is a powerful tool for treating specific infections and saving people's lives when it is used properly. The purpose of antibiotics is to destroy or inhibit the growth of bacteria that cause illness. They are used in many situations, such as treating pneumonia, strep throat, urinary tract infections, skin infections, and more.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-item">
          <h2 class="section-title">How It Is Made</h2>
          <p class="section-text">Antibiotics can be made in different ways. Some are naturally produced by fungi or bacteria in the environment to kill competing microbes, while others are synthetically manufactured or chemically modified in laboratories to improve their effectiveness and reduce side effects. A well-known example of antibiotics is Penicillin. It was originally produced from a mold called Penicillium notatum. In the early stages of Penicillin production, the mold was cultivated in specialized containers, and the antibiotic compound was extracted and purified. Today, Penicillin and other antibiotics are mass-produced using advanced fermentation and biotechnology methods in pharmaceutical factories to ensure safety, consistency, and large-scale availability.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-item">
          <h2 class="section-title">When It Is Made</h2>
          <p class="section-text">In September 1928, a microbiologist, Dr. Alexander Fleming, observed the growth of bacteria in a petri dish. It contains Staphylococcus aureus contaminated by a blue-green mold; later, it was identified as Penicillium notatum. This accidental discovery happened when Dr. Fleming left petri dishes of bacteria uncovered and returned from a vacation to find that mold had killed the bacteria in one dish. This moment marked the birth of modern antibiotics. Although Fleming discovered Penicillin in 1928, it wasn’t until the early 1940s, during World War II, that scientists like Howard Florey, Ernst Boris Chain, and Norman Heatley worked to purify and mass-produce Penicillin to treat wounded soldiers and civilians. The first wide-scale use of Penicillin occurred around 1942–1943, dramatically reducing deaths from bacterial infection.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-item">
          <h2 class="section-title">Who Made It</h2>
          <p class="section-text">Dr. Alexander Fleming discovered Penicillin when he noticed that the mold Penicillium notatum had killed bacteria in a petri dish. He is credited with the discovery of the first antibiotic. Later, a team of scientists including Howard Florey and Ernst Chain helped develop it for medical use, enabling its mass production and application in hospitals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-item">
          <h2 class="section-title">Contribution To Society</h2>
          <p class="section-text">Nowadays, Penicillin is widely used in hospitals as an antibiotic. The discovery of Penicillin benefits everyone by providing a way to cure a bacterial infection inside the body that can be a struggle to overcome. It is a life-saving discovery that makes it a critical breakthrough, offering protection and better health worldwide. It paves the way for a healthier future. The contribution of antibiotics to society is monumental. Before antibiotics, even minor bacterial infections could lead to death. Since their development, millions of lives have been saved, and countless medical procedures, such as surgeries, chemotherapy, and organ transplants, have become safer. Antibiotics have helped reduce hospital stays, prevent the spread of disease, and improve quality of life around the globe. However, with growing antibiotic resistance due to overuse and misuse, it is important to use antibiotics responsibly to ensure they continue to protect future generations.</p>
