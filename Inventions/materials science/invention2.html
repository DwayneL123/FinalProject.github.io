          <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
          <p class="section-text">Iron and steel are ferrous metals that became foundational materials of the Industrial Age, particularly the Second Industrial Revolution starting around 1850. Steel, an alloy of iron and primarily carbon, gained prominence due to its exceptional tensile strength and relatively low production cost, making it ideal for widespread use in construction and various industrial applications. The unique properties of both iron and steel arise from the crystalline structures of iron (body-centered cubic and face-centered cubic) and their interaction with carbon and other alloying elements, which act as hardening agents by impeding the movement of dislocations within the iron's crystal lattice. Instead of being rare and expensive, iron and especially steel became the go-to materials for building big things like bridges, tall buildings, and railroads. They were also essential for making machines and tools, as well as for building ships and trains. Steel, being stronger than earlier types of iron, allowed for even bigger and tougher structures and more powerful machines, really driving the advancements of industry. </p>

          <p class="section-text">Before the mass production era, steel was costly and made in small quantities through laborious processes. The breakthrough in massproducing affordable steel came with Henry Bessemer's invention of the Bessemer converter in 1855. This process involved pouring molten pig iron from a blast furnace into a large crucible and then blowing air through it from below. The air ignited the dissolved carbon from the coke in the pig iron. As the carbon burned off, the melting point increased, but the heat generated by the burning carbon maintained the molten state. The process was halted when the carbon content reached the desired level for steel production. Later modifications improved the uniformity of the steel produced. While the Second Industrial Revolution, characterized by the rise of steel, began around 1850, a reliable method for the mass manufacture of steel wasn't invented until the 1860s with Bessemer's process, becoming widely adopted in the 1870s. Before this period, steel was an expensive specialty product.</p>

          <p class="section-text">The key figure in revolutionizing steel production was Henry Bessemer, who introduced the Bessemer converter in 1855 at his steelworks in Sheffield, England. His invention provided the first cost-effective method for massproducing steel. The ability to make cheap steel in large amounts completely changed society. It allowed for the building of things that were never before possible, like skyscrapers and huge bridges, and made train travel widespread thanks to extensive railways. Factories could use stronger, more efficient machines made of steel. Steel was also key for building better ships. Basically, steel was a fundamental material that powered much of the technological progress and the big societal changes that happened in the late 1800s and the 1900s.</p>
